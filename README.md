## Discord Bot for lewd.sx

uh, basically, this is a really half assed bot that plays music from a spotify playlist; i wouldn't consider the code amazing or anything, but it works so i'm happy with it.

### how 2 install
it's really easy, just follow these steps:
1. clone the repo
2. `cd` into the folder
3. run `npm install` (make sure you append `--unsafe-perm` to the end if you're installing the bot as the root user on your server)
4. copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your details

that's basically it for now

### but neko y can't i request songs it say it broked?!
ye, because of spotify's api the bot has to get some permissions through a method that's as enjoyable as eating a pinecone, but don't worry about that for now because i'll be pushing some nice code that makes it so i can do that without having to worry about permissions soon.

### how 2 contribute
just submit pull requests or whatever
